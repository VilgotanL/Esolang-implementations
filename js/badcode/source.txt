I have an idea for an esolang but i still need a compiler/intepreper.
It's called BadCode and this is how it works:
1: adds one
0: subtracts one
2: multiplies by two
o: prints the character as an ascii value
O:prints a number
I still need an interpreter, if someone can help me please contact me in private
