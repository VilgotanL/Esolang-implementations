This program should print: -3
This program tests the div command operand order, negative denominator and result, and integer truncation (casting to int)
Explanation: this program prints 31 / (0 - 8) which is -3.875, which when casted to an integer gets "truncated towards zero" which means remove decimal part
If an interpreter were to floor or round it, it would get -2 which is incorrect
And if an interpreter forgot to cast it, it would print -3.875, which is also incorrect
If an interpreter were to do A/B instead of B/A, and do floor/round/trunc or nothing, it would also give an incorrect answer
